### Hi there 👋

👋 Hi! I'm Sayaka, a fullstack developer based in Stockholm. I recently graduated with a degree in Computer Science from Linnaeus University 🎓, having completed my studies during my second and third parental leaves. Before transitioning into tech, I spent many years working in healthcare. I chose this new career path because it perfectly blends my love for problem-solving and creativity. Outside of work, I enjoy staying active, cooking, and exploring new places ✈️!<br/><br/>
